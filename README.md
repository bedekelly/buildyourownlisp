BuildYourOwnLisp
=================

My own, slightly modified version of [BuildYourOwnLisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com). Mainly to fill in some gaps in my knowledge about Lisp, but also proving helpful for things I've had less opportunity/reason to use in C like C11 anonymous unions. Will probably expand at some point to use linked lists and cons cells instead of the strange variable-length array this seems to be building towards.
